# Spanish YouTube Word Analyzer Project

## Project Overview

Building a web-based tool to help learn Spanish by extracting and analyzing word frequency from YouTube videos.
Target user: Someone learning Spanish who wants to understand which words appear most frequently in Spanish content.

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Python 3, Flask web framework
- YouTube API: youtube-transcript-api library
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, vanilla JavaScript
- Styling: Custom CSS with responsive design
- Python Environment: venv (virtual environment)

## Current Project Structure

spanish-youtube-tool/
├── app.py # Flask backend with transcript fetching
├── requirements.txt # Python dependencies
├── templates/
│ └── index.html # Main UI with word frequency display
├── static/
│ └── style.css # Styling with red Spanish theme
└── venv/ # Virtual environment (not tracked)

## Current Features (Working)

- Extract YouTube video ID from various URL formats
- Fetch Spanish transcripts (handles multiple Spanish variants: es, es-419, es-ES, etc.)
- Count word frequency with Spanish character support (á, é, í, ó, ú, ñ, ü)
- Display top 100 most frequent words in a responsive grid
- Show total unique word count
- Error handling with helpful messages about available languages
- Loading spinner during processing

## Recent Fixes

- Fixed transcript fetching using .list_transcripts() and .fetch() pattern
- Improved error messages to show available languages when Spanish not found
- Added support for auto-generated transcripts

## Code Style Preferences

- Clear, descriptive function names
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Comments for complex logic
- Type hints where helpful (optional)
- Follow PEP 8 Python style guide
- Modern ES6+ JavaScript (async/await, arrow functions)
- Semantic HTML5
- Accessible UI with proper contrast and labeling

## Known Issues/Limitations

- Only works with videos that have Spanish captions/transcripts
- Requires manual URL input (no playlist support yet)
- Basic word extraction (doesn't handle phrases or context)

## Planned Features (Not Yet Implemented)

1. Export word list to CSV/Anki format
2. Filter common words (articles, prepositions)
3. Show words in context (display sentence where word appears)
4. Support for multiple videos/playlist analysis
5. Word difficulty levels (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
6. Add words and phrases to a database
7. Add pronunciation guides or translations
8. Batch analysis of multiple videos

## Development Guidelines

- Test with various Spanish content (news, tutorials, vlogs)
- Maintain responsive design for mobile learning
- Keep the UI simple and focused on learning
- Prioritize performance for large transcripts
- Use semantic variable names that reflect Spanish learning context

## Common Test URLs

- Spanish news channels
- Spanish learning tutorials
- Spanish podcasts on YouTube
- Music videos with Spanish lyrics (if captions available)

## Assistance Requested

When providing help, please:

- Maintain the existing project structure
- Keep the Spanish learning focus
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Test error handling with edge cases
- Consider Spanish language peculiarities (accents, ñ, etc.)
